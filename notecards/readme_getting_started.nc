                    Getting Started with Fourmilab Fireworks

Rez Fourmilab Fireworks on land where you're allowed to create objects.

For a quick demonstration, just touch the launcher.  The top will open,
a series of fireworks will be launched (the kind of burst, colour,
height, and direction are randomly chosen and will be different every
time), then the top will close.

You can send commands to the launcher via local chat channel 1749.  The
launcher includes a number of demonstration scripts, described in the
separate notecard "README: Demonstration Scripts".  To list all the
scripts in the launcher, use the command in local chat:
    /1749 script list
(You can abbreviate almost all commands to as few as two characters, so
you can type "/1749 sc li" if you prefer.)

To run a demonstration script, for example one of the shows from the
Fourmilab Fireworks YouTube video:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzBMy3w8WMU
use the chat command:
    /1749 script run YT Hat Show
This show begins with a clip from Handel's "Music for the Royal
Fireworks", illustrating how you can use sound clips to add music,
sound effects, or narration to your scripted shows.

You can use a series of sound clips to play longer pieces of music.  To
run a show accompanied by the finale of Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture",
use:
    /1749 script run 1812

You can also accompany your shows with music or sound effects from
resources on the Web such as YouTube or the Internet Archive.  The
following presents a show set to a 1939 recording of Glenn Miller's "In
the Mood" from the Internet Archive.
    /1749 script run In the Mood

Fourmilab Fireworks is able to generate any optical effect which can be
defined in Second Life.  You can assemble custom shows from the effects
supplied with the products or define your own.  To see all of the
effects included with Fourmilab Fireworks, run:
    /1749 script run Burst Demonstration
To learn how to create your own custom bursts, see the notecard:
    Fourmilab Fireworks Optical Effect Compiler
in the main product directory.

In addition to being rezzed on land, Fourmilab Fireworks can be worn as
an avatar attachment, usually a hat.  This allows you to use it in
locations where you're not permitted to rez objects and to take it with
you as move around and/or teleport among regions in Second Life.
Delete the fireworks launcher you created earlier (to avoid confusion)
and, from your inventory, select Fourmilab Fireworks and use Add to add
it to your outfit.  It will sit on your head as a hat.  You may, if you
wish, adjust its position by editing it and moving and tilting it.
When worn as a hat, Fourmilab Fireworks accepts the same chat commands
as when rezzed on land and may be touched to run the default show. To
launch a salvo from the hat, use:
    /1749 script run YT Hat Salvo
If you want to have a launcher rezzed in world and wear one as a hat at
the same time, change the channel of the rezzed launcher, for example:
    /1749 channel 1750
and then you can send commands to the rezzed launcher with /1750 and
the hat with /1749.

Wearing the fireworks launcher as a hat allows tricks such as
announcing your arrival after teleporting to a new region with a
fireworks show.  To set this up, run:
    /1749 script run YT Region Announce
and then when you arrive in a new region, you'll tip your hat with a
fireworks show.  To stop this script, use:
    /1749 script run

This introduction only scratches the surface of what you can do with
Fourmilab Fireworks by writing your own scripted shows in notecards.
For complete documentation, see the notecard:
    Fourmilab Fireworks User Guide
included with the product.  You can obtain a copy of that notecard from
the launcher with the command:
    /1749 help
